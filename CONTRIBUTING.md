# How to contribute

Hi. At Open Innovations (formerly ODI Leeds) we like to be #RadicallyOpen so most of our projects and visualisations are published openly. We are a small team and there's a chance that there are bugs or mistakes in our code. Perhaps that is why you are here? We love to get positive contributions and improvements which can then be shared back with others.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).
